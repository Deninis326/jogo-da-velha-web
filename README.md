# Vers√£o 1.1.0 - 07/11/2019

In this version I focused in *separation of concerns* inside the aplication, and for that I created a folder named by **assets**, besides made some design changes and fixed bugs.

## Main changes

* Separation of concerns in code
* Basic changes in design
* Fixed the bug that you need to double click in button restart

### Notes

1. **Assets** is wrappin all the logical functions, for instance, the function responsable for check if some player won the game, or the function that allows a player make a play
2. The logical of all function was improved, thats mean that function are smarter
